### Project Description
The Permity is a College Permission Management System (CPMS) designed to streamline the student permission process, eliminating traditional paperwork. Students can submit, track, and manage requests online, while administrators digitally approve them, ensuring a more efficient, transparent, and time-saving process for everyone involved.

### The Problem statement
We're solving the ridiculous problem of students running around campus, chasing signatures for event venue permissions and attendance claims, wasting time and energy on outdated paperwork instead of focusing on their studies and activities.

### The Solution
We‚Äôre turning the permission chaos into a breeze with **Permity**‚Äîa one-stop, digital system where students can submit requests with a click and watch as approvals flow in, no more signature scavenger hunts or admin dodging! It‚Äôs like giving your paperwork a fast pass!
